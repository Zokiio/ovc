Design Brief for the Designer
Objective:Create a modern, user-friendly web interface for a WebRTC voice chat application with a Hytale-inspired theme and or Discord. The design should reflect the theme outlined, with modern UI/UX principles, and accommodation for the following features:


Core Theme Guidelines:

2. Modern UI Design:
• Responsive design that aligns with current web trends.
• Should support both light and dark mode (if possible).
• Use white space effectively and arrange interactive elements for an intuitive user experience.
• Integrate modern iconography and animations to create a clean look.
3. Color Palette:
• Stick to colors inspired by Hytale or Discord.
• Incorporate vibrant highlights for interactive elements, such as buttons, notifications, and active states.


Features to Include:
1. Landing Page/Sign-In Page:
• Modern, clean landing page to introduce users to the voice chat.
• Include the following elements:
• Space for the app logo and tagline.
• A short description—for example: “Proximity Voice Chat for Hytale Adventures.”
• Fields for Hytale username and server address input.
• A call-to-action button for connecting to the WebRTC server.
2. Server Connection and Status View (ConnectionView):
• Main screen for server connection and microphone/device configuration.
• Features:
• Input for server URL.
• Dropdown/select menu for choosing saved servers.
• Button to connect or save server.
• Real-time server connection status (e.g., “Connected,” “Disconnected”).
• Clear visual representation of network latency (e.g., a status card with latency numbers in milliseconds colored based on health).
3. Group Management (GroupCard):
• A dedicated panel showcasing active communication groups.
• Features:
• Display of active groups with group names.
• Visual management options for creating and joining groups.
• Group member list with per-user volume controls.
• Clear leave and join buttons for groups.
• Space for group admin settings (e.g. password, invite etc).
4. Proximity-based Audio Presentation:
• Visual cues to represent proximity-based audio (e.g., intuitive UI representing closeness to other players).
• For example, use fading visual indicators, like dots or circles, to show players closer or farther away in the voice channel.
5. Voice Activity Detection (VoiceActivityMonitor):
• Indicate when someone is currently speaking.
• Use animated visuals representing voice activity (e.g., glowing circles, waveforms, or color changes).
6. Audio Controls (AudioLevelMeter):
• Present visual microphone level feedback for the user.
• Include a modern slider or spinner element for master volume and individual user volume adjustments.
• Muting options with clear visual feedback.
7. Navigation Bar:
• Feature navigation to pages, such as settings, active voice groups, and server connections.
• Represent sections like “Active Group,” “Global Settings,” and “Help.”
8. Settings Page:
• Allow users to select audio devices (microphone/output).
• Add a toggle feature for light or dark mode.
• Space for advanced configuration settings in future releases.
• The design needs to accommodate expandable settings options but keep it simple and modern.


General Notes for the Designer:
• While the designer has creative autonomy, ensure the design is in line with the theme while leveraging:
• React: The platform is already built on React 19; designs should align with its UI component-based structure.
• Tailwind CSS: Styling should harmonize with utility class-based styles.
• Responsiveness: Make the app functional and appealing on both desktops and mobiles.
